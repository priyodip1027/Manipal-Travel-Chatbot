# Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project is a simple chatbot built using TensorFlow and Keras. The chatbot is trained on intents stored in a JSON file and uses a neural network model for classification. It can respond to various user queries based on the training data.

## Installation
To run the chatbot, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start chatting with the bot, run the following command:

```
python chatbot.py
```

The bot will then prompt you to enter your messages. Type "quit" to exit the chat.

## Files
- `chatbot.py`: Python script containing the chatbot code.
- `intents.json`: JSON file containing training data in the form of intents and responses.
- `tokenizer.pickle`: Pickle file containing the fitted Tokenizer object.
- `label_encoder.pickle`: Pickle file containing the fitted LabelEncoder object.
- `chat_model`: Trained model file saved using TensorFlow's model.save() function.
